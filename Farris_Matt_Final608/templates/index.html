      <h1>Medicare: Hospital Payments vs Readmission and Mortality</h1>

      <p>Medicare, the only federal insurance agency, is a vast and diverse network, 
      that provides regulation, guidance, and authority over all other private insurance 
      agencies. Though most insurances are not mandated to follow Medicare guidelines, many
      agencies adopt the standards set by CMS, of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid, 
      the government agency the oversees all of the Medicare regulations. Because Medicare is 
      so vast, it incorporates one of the largest datasets in the US. Most insurance agencies, 
      because of their proprietary nature, do not release their data to the general public, 
      making analysis of the healthcare industry a very dubious endeavor. However, as a 
      federally run program, Medicare is required to offer its data, in order to maintain 
      transparency. This allows us to get a glimpse inside the world of insurance billing 
      and regulation. 
      	For demonstration, we compared 6 states, along with 4 DRG or Diagnostic Related groups 
      and compared two medicare Indicators: Readmissions and Mortality to see if there was any 
      relationship between payment and these two groups. The DRGs for this project were: 
      HF- Heart Failure, COPD -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disorder, AMI- Acute Myocardial 
      Infarction, and PN -Pneumonia. The 6 states choosen were Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, 
      Washington, and Virginia. The Graph compares payment date to the respective indicator of 
      choice, while the map shows the counties' readmission or mortality rate (based on the 
      hospitals data), along with the hospital payment data. The Size of the circle represents 
      how much the relative amount that that hospital is paid compared to all the other hospitals.
